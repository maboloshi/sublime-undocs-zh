Search Filters
==============

The **Where** field in Find in Files
limits the search scope.
You can define filters in several ways:

* Adding individual directories (Unix-style paths, even on Windows)
* Adding/excluding files based on wildcards
* Adding symbolic locations (``<open folders>``, ``<open files>``...)

Relative paths in filters are interpreted
to start at the root of the active project.

It is also possible
to combine filters using commas.
You can combine filters in any order.
