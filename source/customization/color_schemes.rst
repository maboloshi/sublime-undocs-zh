Color Schemes
=============

Sublime Text uses color schemes
to highlight source code
and to define the colors
of some items in the editing area:
background, foreground, gutter, caret, selection...

Color schemes are fully customizable.

Let's look at a Python file
as Sublime Text highlights it
using the default color scheme *Monokai*:

Selecting a Color Scheme
************************

You can change the current color scheme
by means of the **Preferences → Color Scheme** menu.

A common way of selecting a color scheme
is by associating it to a type of file
using file-type-specific settings.
Select **Preferences → Settings - Syntax Specific**
to open the corresponding settings file
and set the ``color_scheme`` setting.

.. TODO add a reference to that setting

For more information about settings,
see :doc:`settings`.
