====================
Settings â€“ Reference
====================

.. seealso::

   :doc:`Customization - Settings </customization/settings>`
      A detailed overview on settings in Sublime Text and their order of
      precedence.


Global Settings
===============

.. FIXME: Wrong information

Global settings can only be modified
in :file:`Preferences.sublime-settings` and :file:`Preferences (<platform>).sublime-settings`
(where ``<platform>`` can be any of ``Linux``, ``OSX`` or ``Windows``)
and, where indicated, also in :file:`.sublime-project` files.

.. XXX obviously, some settings are missing here ... but do we really need to
.. include all the settings with a brief description? That's what the comments
.. in the default settings are for, actually.
