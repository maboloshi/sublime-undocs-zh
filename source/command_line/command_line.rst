Command Line Usage
==================

Sublime Text includes a command-line helper called ``subl``.
Using the command-line helper,
you can open files and folders
and perform other actions
from the command line.

Before using ``subl``, make sure
it is on your ``PATH``.
To put ``subl`` on your ``PATH``,
you may need to add directories to ``PATH``
or use symbolic links.
